# :rocket: Daniel’s memory card game

A simple ten-piece memory card game.

You can [play the game here](https://bence-toth.github.io/daniel-memory-game/).


## Inspiration and acknowledgements

We built this game together with my (at the time of writing) two-year-old son, Daniel.

We have tried a few online memory games, and he had difficulties handling and properly understanding how to control the mouse.

So I promised him that we make one which he _can_ play.

He has contributed greatly acting as:

- delivery manager, asking for daily status updates and challenging me to focus,

- designer, delicately picking all card faces and colors,

- usability and accessibility tester, providing useful input while driving numerous testing sessions,

- model, contributing his perfect little arm as mouse cursor.

Without him, this could not have happened, I am very proud of him, and I am eternally grateful. :heart:

Let this project we worked on together be the first one of the many to come.
